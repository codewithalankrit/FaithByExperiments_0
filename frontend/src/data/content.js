    title: "About the Founder",
    content: `Ajit Kumar is a mechanical engineer by training, a systems thinker by practice, and an experimentalist by temperament. With over two decades of professional experience in large-scale industrial environments—spanning petroleum refineries, petrochemical complexes, and complex project ecosystems—Ajit has spent his career solving problems where assumptions fail and evidence matters. His work has demanded rigor, data-driven reasoning, and the humility to test ideas against reality—qualities that now define his approach to questions of faith, meaning, and inner life.

Educated as an engineer and certified as a project management professional, Ajit's intellectual journey later expanded into artificial intelligence, applied data science, and generative models, where he continues to explore how complex systems learn, adapt, and evolve.

Across engineering, AI, and leadership roles, one pattern became clear: beliefs that are not tested eventually break—whether in machines, organizations, or human lives. Faith by Experiments was born from this realization. Rather than asking people to believe first, this platform invites them to observe, test, reflect, and verify—using life itself as the laboratory.

Drawing inspiration from scientific thinking, lived experience, and timeless philosophical insights, Ajit approaches faith not as dogma, but as a hypothesis worth examining.

This venture is especially designed for:

• Engineers, scientists, professionals, and rational thinkers
• Individuals disillusioned by blind belief yet unsatisfied by material explanations alone
• Seekers who value intellectual honesty over certainty

Ajit does not claim final answers. Instead, he offers structured experiments, reflective frameworks, and real-world observations that allow readers to test deeper questions for themselves:

• Does intention influence outcomes?
• Can disciplined inner practices produce measurable external change?
• Is meaning an illusion—or an emergent property of lived experimentation?

At its core, Faith by Experiments is not about converting minds—it is about engaging them. Ajit believes that when faith is approached with the same seriousness as science—open to falsification, grounded in experience, and free from fear—it becomes not weaker, but profoundly stronger.`,

    previewContent: `Scholars estimate that there are <strong>several thousand distinct religions</strong> around the world — commonly cited at over 4,000 — ranging from major global traditions to local indigenous practices. It exists because, at different points in history, individuals realized that the practices they inherited were <strong>not producing results</strong> in their own lives. These individuals were not rebels by default. They were curious, dissatisfied, and willing to search for meaning that actually <strong>worked</strong> for them. What they discovered eventually became systems of faith—methods, disciplines, and practices that aligned with their lived experience rather than inherited expectation. Most of us never pause to notice this. We continue with familiar practices, hoping they will someday deliver different outcomes. Often, they do not. The uncomfortable truth is that <strong>faith cannot be outsourced</strong>. Each individual must arrive at a system that resonates with their own mind, temperament, and lived reality. This has always been true. Every person who discovered a transformative form of faith did so by <strong>finding their own way</strong>—not by copying outcomes, but by discovering principles. The question then arises: must one withdraw from the world, sit in isolation, or spend years in seclusion to arrive at such clarity? Not necessarily. What unites most of these seekers was not withdrawal, but <strong>experimentation</strong>. They questioned what they were taught, tested alternatives, observed results, and refined their understanding. Experimentation—not inheritance—was the common thread. From my experience, I am convinced that <strong>every human being is capable of this</strong>. Over the last 26 years, beginning at the age of nineteen, I have explored these questions through sustained personal experimentation, alongside the study of over a hundred books—including foundational texts from multiple religious traditions—and relevant scientific research from across the world. From this body of inquiry, I have distilled a sequence of steps: structured, testable, and grounded in lived experience. What follows is not belief. It is an experiment.`,
