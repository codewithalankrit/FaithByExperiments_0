<analysis>original_problem_statement:
The user wants to build a premium, author-style website with an editorial and intellectual tone.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Content:**
    *   Display content for About the Founder, Manifesto, and Flagship Contents from provided documents.
    *   The founder's name, Ajit Kumar, should be under his portrait.

    *   The How the Work is Structured section should use a specific list of bullet points provided by the user.
    *   The homepage must have a Flagship Contents Preview section that shows text from a document and a button that intelligently links to either the subscribe page (for guests) or the full contents page (for subscribers).

2.  **Branding & Style:**
    *   Use a light theme with a soft, off-white background and dark text.
    *   Use the specific logo and founder's portrait images provided by the user.
    *   The design should be clean, minimal, with plenty of whitespace and an editorial/book-like feel. No flashy colors, animations, or SaaS-style cards.

3.  **Subscription System:**
    *   A full subscription system is required (not just a mockup).
    *   A premium, two-column pricing section on the homepage detailing Monthly and Yearly plans.
    *   A redesigned, premium subscribe/signup page.
    *   Content locking for non-subscribed users.
    *   All references to Membership should be changed to Subscription. No Best Value badges or lock icons should be visible.

4.  **Navigation:**
    *   A responsive header with a hamburger menu for mobile/tablet.
    *   The header should include navigation links, a Subscribe button, and a Sign In button to its right.
    *   Clicking on links should always scroll the new page to the top.

5.  **Admin Panel:**
    *   A full admin dashboard for managing Flagship Content posts (Create, Read, Edit, Delete).

**what currently exists?**
A complete and responsive frontend for the author-style website has been built using React. It accurately reflects all the user's detailed UI/UX and content requests. It includes a , ,  (which also handles sign-in), , and a full suite of mock-functional admin pages (, , ).

All data and state (including content, user authentication, and admin posts) are currently mocked. Content is stored in , while authentication status and admin-managed posts are stored in the browser's . The frontend has been wired to read from  so changes in the mock admin panel are reflected on the live pages.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was connecting the live frontend pages to the data managed by the mock admin dashboard (stored in ). This was to ensure that any changes made in the admin panel (e.g., editing a post) would immediately appear on the live website pages. The agent successfully updated the  listing page and was in the process of updating the individual content detail page.
- Status: **IN PROGRESS**
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? **Frontend testing agent**. The agent should test the full mock CRUD flow: 1. Log in as admin. 2. Create a new post and verify it appears on the live site. 3. Edit the post and verify the changes. 4. Delete the post and verify its removal.
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1**: (P0) The connection between the admin panel and the live site is incomplete.
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
  - **Next debug checklist**:
    - The agent needs to finish updating  to load its content dynamically from  based on the URL slug.
    - The  section on the  also needs to be updated to use the dynamic data from  instead of the static  file.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will complete the frontend prototype, making it fully interactive. All admin changes will be reflected across the entire mock site, providing a complete demonstration of functionality before backend development.
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1**: Complete dynamic data integration for the frontend.
  - **Where to resume**: The agent should start by editing  to fetch post data from  using the slug from the URL parameters, similar to how  was modified.
  - **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully functional frontend prototype where content is managed through the mock admin interface.
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
  - **(P0) Backend Implementation**: This is the most critical next step.
    - **User Authentication**: Create backend endpoints for user signup, login, and session management.
    - **Database Models**: Define MongoDB schemas for  and  (Flagship Content).
    - **Admin CRUD API**: Build secure API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts. Only authenticated admins should have access.
    - **Content API**: Create public-facing API endpoints to fetch flagship content for the live pages.
    - **Subscription Logic**: Implement endpoints to manage user subscription status (e.g., after a successful payment).

  - **(P1) Frontend-Backend Integration**:
    - Replace all mock authentication logic () in , , and other components with API calls to the new backend.
    - Replace all mock data fetching () in , , and  with API calls.
    - Connect the admin post editor form to the new CRUD endpoints.

- **Future Tasks**:
  - **(P2) Payment Gateway Integration**: Integrate a payment provider (e.g., Stripe) to handle real subscription payments. This will involve creating a checkout flow and using webhooks to update the user's subscription status in the database.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Frontend Scaffolding**: Built a multi-page React application with a light, editorial theme, including , ,  (list & detail), , and admin pages.
- **UI/UX Refinements**:
  - Iteratively designed a premium, two-column subscription section on the homepage.
  - Redesigned the  for a premium, editorial feel.
  - Implemented a responsive header with a hamburger menu.
  - Integrated user-provided logo and founder portrait.
- **Content & Formatting**:
  - Added all user-requested content and applied specific formatting (justified text, bullet points).
- **Admin Dashboard**: Created a complete, mock-functional admin dashboard with UI for CRUD operations on posts.
- **Functionality & Bug Fixes**:
  - Implemented smart navigation for the admin, allowing login from the main user sign-in page.
  - Fixed a navigation bug where pages would not scroll to the top on route changes by creating a  component.
  - Connected the mock admin panel to the live pages using  (in progress).

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, React Router (, , , , , , )
- **State Management**: , , 
- **Styling**: Plain CSS with media queries for responsiveness.
- **Mocking**: Using browser  to simulate a database for authentication state (, ) and content ().
- **Data Handling**: Using  and  to manage objects in .

**key DB schema**
(Not yet implemented. The following are suggested schemas for future backend development)
- **users**: 
- **posts**: 

**All files of reference**
- : Contains all route definitions, including for admin pages.
- : The main landing page, which has undergone significant changes.
- : A critical component serving as both the user subscription and login page, with logic to redirect admins.
- : The main interface for mock content management, reading from and writing to .
- : The live page that lists posts, recently updated to read from .
- : The page that needs to be updated to complete the mock data flow.
- : Contains the responsive navigation logic.
- : A utility component created to fix a navigation bug.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The entire application is a **frontend-only prototype**. Do not attempt to interact with a real backend yet.
- All database operations are mocked using . The key for posts is . The key for authentication is .
- The immediate task is to finish wiring the frontend to  to complete the prototype.
- The next major phase of work, once the prototype is approved, will be to build the entire backend and replace all the mock  logic with real API calls.
- Admin credentials for the mock login are  and .
